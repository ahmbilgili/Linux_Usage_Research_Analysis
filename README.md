# Linux_Usage_Research_Analysis  

## Motivation  
With the discontinuation of Windows 10 support from Microsoft, the current users of Windows 10 (excluding LTSC and IoT versions) will not be able to receive support, including security updates. This raises concerns amongst users, primarily due to security concerns. Some experts believe that there will be a noticeable shift towards linux systems, resulting in changes among OS market shares, while some experts believe that there won't be any noticeable shift. My research aims to come up with a satisfactory result that gives an answer to the given question, whether if there is (and will be in the future) a noticeable shift, or not.

## Hypotheses  
**H0 (Null Hypothesis)**: There isn't any noticeable shift from windows systems to linux systems after ending of windows 10 support.  
**H1 (Alternative Hypothesis)**: There is a noticeable shift from windows systems to linux systems after ending of windows 10 support.  
## Data Collection  
Data of OS Market Shares from 2009 to 2025 will be used for analyzing previous and current trends of linux and windows usage, in order to understand whether if there is a significant change in market shares. I believe that there's a close correlation between number of open source repositories and linux user count, so the number of repositories that include the keyword "linux" and "open source" from the same period will be analyzed for further investigation. Wikimedia API will be used for analyzing number of pageviews in topics such as "ubuntu", "mint", "debian" and "open source", which are concepts related to linux, since interest in these topics possibly corresponds to more demand for linux systems.
